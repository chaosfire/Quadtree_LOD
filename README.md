### Quadtree LOD - Rendering planets and surfaces

**Summary** 
Implementation of a Quadtree LOD in terrain rendering (such as planets). The representation of the planet is with an ellipsoid. Im hoping this will result in either a complete planet rendering engine or something that will help me in my upcoming project with the Unreal Engine 4.

**Coordinate Systems**
The coordinate systems used are :

* Geographic coordinates - Tuple(lng, lat, height)
* Cartesian coordinate system - for addressing the viewports and screen stuff
